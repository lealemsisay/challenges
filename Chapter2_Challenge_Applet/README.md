Bouncing Text Applet
 # Chapter 2 Challenge 4: : Bouncing Text Applet
    A Java Applet that demonstrates animated text bouncing around the screen with smooth collision detection and real-time position tracking. This program showcases classic Java Applet programming with animation threads and graphics rendering.

## Project Details
- **Project Name**:Chapter2_Challenge_Applet
- **Java Class**: ` Chapter2_Challenge_Applet.java`
- **Package**: `Chapter2_Challenge_Applet`
- **Technology**: Java Console Application
- **Visual Effects**: Real-time position and velocity tracking

***

##  Mission Objective
    Create an interactive animated applet that displays text bouncing around the screen with perfect collision detection against boundaries, demonstrating core animation principles and Java AWT graphics.

***

## How the Analysis Works
 The applet creates a continuous animation where text moves around the screen:
1. **Text Movement**: "Bouncing Text!" moves with constant velocity
2. **Collision Detection**: Bounces off all four screen boundaries
3. **Real-time Tracking**: Displays current position and velocity
4. **Smooth Animation**: 30ms frame rate for fluid motion
