 # Chapter 2: The Applet Archaeologist - Bouncing Text Animation

## Project Overview
This Java Applet demonstrates **deprecated Java web technology** with a multi-directional bouncing text animation. Created as an educational project to explore Java's web past and understand the evolution of web technologies.

## Project Details
- **Project Name**: BouncingTextApplet
- **Java Class**: `BouncingTextApplet.java`
- **HTML File**: `BouncingTextApplet.html`
- **Technology**: Java Applet (Deprecated)
- **Purpose**: Educational/Historical demonstration

## What This Applet Does
- Displays green text bouncing in ALL directions (top, bottom, left, right)
- Implements realistic velocity-based physics
- Shows real-time position and velocity coordinates
- Demonstrates the complete Applet lifecycle
- Includes visual boundaries, center crosshair, and status information

## Features
- Multi-directional bouncing with collision detection
- Real-time physics simulation
- Visual feedback with position/velocity display
- Adjustable speed and initial direction

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or later (applets are deprecated in newer versions)
- Command line terminal

### Steps to Run
1. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac BouncingTextApplet.java
2. **Run using appletviewer:**

   ```bash
    appletviewer BouncingTextApplet.html
