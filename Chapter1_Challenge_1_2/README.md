 # Chapter 1 Challenge 2:  Lottory Number Analyzer

##  Project Overview
 A Java application that analyzes lottery numbers by calculating the sum and average of their digits. This program demonstrates core Java concepts including arrays, string manipulation, loops, and mathematical operations.

***

## Project Details
- **Project Name**: Chapter1_Challenge_1_2
- **Java Class**: `Chapter1_Challenge_1_2.java`
- **Package**: `Chapter1_Challenge_1_2`
- **Technology**: Java Console Application

***

##  Mission Objective
 Analyze multiple lottery numbers to determine which number has the highest average digit value by processing each number's individual digits and performing statistical calculations.

***

## How the Analysis Works
For each lottery number like "12-34-56-78-90", the program:1. **Removes dashes**  to create a continuous digit string
2. **Converts each character**  to its numerical value
3. **Calculates the sum**  of all digits
4. **Computes the average**  by dividing sum by number of digits
5. **Compare the averages**  across all numbers to find the highest
